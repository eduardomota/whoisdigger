## Important notice

Its your sole responsibility of what you do with this tool, check the licence section for more information. This tool intended use is to let anyone have a chance at finding a good domain in a crowded space, such as a good `.com`. A non conforming practice and use of the tool according to your local laws may land you criminal or civil liabilities. Other than that keep in mind that repeated whois requests to a server will eventually result in IP blacklisting for example, you should have a conservative values for time between requests and bit of common sense to minimize your risks, don't do huge bulk lookups at once and/or with the same IP, preferably use different proxies between requests.

## Quick start

Stay on the bleeding edge of whoisdigger commits using `git clone` or for slightly tested version download the latest built release.

### Latest built binary

Check out and download the latest release for your architecture/OS.

[![Check out releases](https://img.shields.io/badge/Checkout%20releases-%20-orange.svg)](https://github.com/whois-team/whoisdigger/releases)

### Latest changes

Basic whoisdigger requirements are `node`, `npm` and `git`.

Clone whoisdigger code and install dependencies

```
git clone https://github.com/whois-team/whoisdigger
npm install
```

After clone, run using

```
npm start
```

### Debug

Windows Powershell

```
npm run debug-powershell
```

Windows Command Line

```
npm run debug-cmd
```

### Using wordlists

You can use wordlists by either using a file wordlist in text format or manually input using the text area option. Wordlists should follow the sanitization requirements below for the best results although they're not mandatory. Not following the requirements will result in adverse or unwanted results.

- Deduplicated
- No spaces (if intended)
- No subdomains
- One domain per line
- No TLDs
- UTF-8 encoded

Example wordlist

wordlist.txt (Text file)

```
pow
mow
cow
low
tow
```

Wordlists by manual input should follow the same rules with the only difference of being pasted at input stage.

#### Sample wordlists

Whoisdigger provides sample wordlists as example for testing purposes inside `sample_lists` folder.

### Exporting bulk processing results

When choosing export options, you can decide what domain status to export, if you want errors included, only basic domain information such as creation, expiration and update dates.

Exporting as text will only export raw replies for each domain in a zip file, as a csv you're able to see both both basic information and whois replies (in text, inline csv or separate csv inside a zip file).

### Notes on errors

Errors during bulk lookups are common due to the cadence of requests, this means that you'll have requests getting blocked, rejected, throttled or delayed. Errors may signal that a domain is already registered, at times you can assume that but take into account the domain name, tld and probability of it being registered. Whoisdigger includes assumptions for specific scenarios, see assumptions for more.

## Settings

Whoisdigger uses a settings file that rules how the application behaves in the overall, currently you can only change this if you use the git version.

### Assumptions

You can use assumptions with whoisdigger making it more reliable in case you're getting inconsistencies across different tests.

`uniregistry`, Assume a domain is unavailable when uniregistry query limit is reached, default is true.

â€‹	Note: Uniregistry whois has a very low threshold on whois requests, a few requests with relative small timings in between will result in a temporary block, by assuming a rate limiting reply from uniregistry as a taken domain, you ensure that you're not getting a false positive error.

`ratelimit`, Assume a domain is unavailable when getting rate limited, default is false

`unparsable`, Assume a domain as available if reply is unparsable, default is false
